# Git Commands
The purpose of this file is for you to demonstrate your knowledge of working with the terminal (because we can't otherwise know which commands you entered in the terminal). Think of it as a way to document the code that you used in the terminal to perform the assignment. Following each prompt below, write the line of code that you would (did) use on the terminal to accomplish the task. You can then use this file as a reference for your own work.

```bash
# Print your working directory
pwd
# List the files in your current directory
ls
# Change your directory to a folder in which you do work for this class
C:\Users\evank> cd '.\INFO 201 A1\'
# Clone your assignment repository from GitHub to your machine
git clone https://github.com/info-201a-sp21/a1-PurpTrench.git
# Using a *relative path*, change your directory to inside the repository you just cloned
cd '.\a1-PurpTrench\'
# Make a new folder called "imgs" - you'll download an image into this folder
mkdir imgs
# Add all of your changes that you've made to git
git add README.md
git add imgs
# Make a commit of your changes, including a descriptive message
git commit -m "Added links to the 'Other highlights' section with each linking to different articles, fixed ingenuity.jpeg not displaying, created text box, and created three sentence paragraph with bold, italicized, and hyperlinked words."
# Push your change up to GitHub
git push
```

# Finding Cheat Sheets

A cheat sheet is a website (or document) that has a list of commonly used commands for a program or programming language.

Search Google for *git cheat sheets*, look through several, and choose your favorite. Below copy the url of your favorite one and below it write a sentence explaining why that one was your favorite.

This was my preferred git cheat sheet because it compartmentalized each command while also listing the process of uploading your changes to GitHub.

Search Google for *markdown cheat sheets*, look through several, and choose your favorite. Below copy the url of your favorite one and below it write a sentence explaining why that one was your favorite.

I found this cheat sheet to be my favorite because of its concise descriptions of each way to format text and its organized format.
